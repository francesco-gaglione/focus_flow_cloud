        # Assuming .env.example exists in app/ or we should use the one from repo root?
        # User's ci.yml had `cp .env.example .env`.
        # I listed app/ dir earlier, let's assume it's there or user will consistent it.
        # Check file list: Step 22 showed `.env.example` in root, not in app.
        # Wait, step 22 showed `app` contents:
        # {"name":".env.example", "sizeBytes":"421"} was in step 21 which was backend dir (Wait, step 21 was `focus_flow_cloud/backend`? No)
        # Step 21 was `list_dir backend`. Yes usually backend has env.
        # Step 22 was `list_dir app`. It did NOT show `.env.example`.
        # So `cp .env.example .env` in the original pipeline might have referred to root?
        # But `run: cp .env.example .env` runs in working config.
        # If I change working-directory to `app`, I might need to copy from `../.env.example` if it's in root.
        # However, looking at file list 22, no .env.example in app.
        # In step 7 (root dir list), I didn't see .env.example.
        # Step 21 (backend dir list) showed .env.example.
        # The user provided `ci.yml` says `cp .env.example .env`. This implies it was there.
        # Maybe the user moved things.
        # I will change this to `touch .env` or just remove it if not needed for build, but analyze usually doesn't need env unless generated code does.
        # Safe bet: `touch .env` to avoid failure if it's just expected to exist.
